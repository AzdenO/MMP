Meeting Notes:

1. Declan said he had investigated the Destiny 2 proposition and came up with the idea
for a coach aimed at new players, noting that the game is famously difficult for newer
players to learn. He has looked at the Bungie API documentation as well as alternate
implementations of it, such as a python wrapper that exists for the API ("aiobungie")
on github that would allow for easier implementation. Declan says he prefers this idea 
to the news one. He briefly described the game and its mechanics and the features it could
involve, these being:

-Suggest builds for certain activities
-Suggest new activities and weapons based on players history
-Knowledge base for each effect that a chatbot can explain clearer than the game does
-Live suggestions based on where a player is currently in the game

2. Chaun notes it is good he is thinking ahead about implementation but made notes on the
target platform, that being a web-based deployment should be considered, which could target
both mobile and desktop users due to in-built responsive design for html. 

3. Chaun also mentioned "langchain" as an API that can help format input and responses from the chatbot
into something more easily digestable by the backend, reducing the need for complex algorithms that
breakdown chatbot responses into something useful. Declan said he will investigate this further.

New Business(In no specific order):

-Investigate possible langchain implementation and useful
-Further define features
-Create a final version project outline
