Project Title: AI-Driven Destiny 2 Player Coach
Diary Entry: 3
Date: 11/02/2025
Author: Declan Roy Alan Wadsworth (drw8)

Contents:

1. First full draft of requirements specification is finished and ready for review

2. Continued with target platform analysis document, adding in target audience and
use case section as well as placeholders for other sections. Also added document 
history. While I have now selected a client-server web-based approach as the best
target platform, it is in keeping with software engineering practices to perform
an official investigation. 

Next Day Business:

1. Seperate target audience specification from target platform analysis document, into
its own document.

2. Finish full-draft of target-platform analysis document.

3. Possibly begin setting up project through NetBeans WebStorm IDE
