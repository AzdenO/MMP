# MMP: Destiny 2 Player Coach (Vanguard Mentor)

The remote repository for the MMP project.

## Project Aims

This project aims to utilize arising chatbot technologies to fulfill a specific and complex task.

The project currently proposes creating a Destiny 2 player coach that can suggest character builds for specific activities, provide a knowledge base the player can refer to, as well as suggest new activities and builds to practice with to build skills. All of this being based off of the integration of Destiny 2`s API to fetch a players information for tailored responses. 

The game is notoriously hard for new players to understand and build skills, so the proposed piece of software aims to make this process easier and more digestable to new, beginner and intermediary players. 

The project will develop a web-based service utilizing a client-server configuration, using Node.JS as server-side language, and a html front-end, utilizing latest design patterns and standards for webpages.

##Seperation of Stacks

The front-end stack is located in another public repository for hosting purposes (Allows the page to be hosted on github pages):

-Accessible Repo: https://github.com/AzdenO/VanguardMentorClient
-Accessible Client App: https://AzdenO.github.io/VanguardMentorClient/

At the current place in development, functionality of the front-end is limited, merely representative of its stage in development.
