All of this being based off of the integration of Destiny 2`s API to fetch a players information for tailored responses. 

The game is notoriously hard for new players to understand and build skills, so the proposed piece of software aims to make this process easier and more digestable to new, beginner and intermediary players. 

The project will develop a web-based service utilizing a client-server configuration, using Node.JS as server-side language, and a react front-end
